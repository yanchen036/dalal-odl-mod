=== IMPORTANT NOTE ============================================================
I have limited capabilites for supporting the code. Hence the code below is 
provided as it is without any support. 

If you find some bugs, you may report to me and I will fix them. Even better, 
send the files you have fixed and I will upload them directly. 

=== WINDOWS SUPPORT ==========================================================
I have received lots of emails regarding providing the binaries/source for
windows. Due to time-constraints, I will not be able to provide windows
source/binaries. However if are really interested, it is not hard to compile 
it for windows.

All you need to do is 
1. Change image IO part in lear/image/imageio.h such that instead of using 
imlib2, it uses your image io libraries.
2. Fix painting classes lear/image/painter.h and lear/image/pimage.h such 
that it uses your painting routines.

If you have created MS Visual C++ workspace, please send those files to 
me so that I can include them in the package.

=== SVM LEARN FILES ==========================================================
This code does not build svm_learn binary. For that download

http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/soft/olt/svmdense.tar.gz
and build a svm_learn binary. A pre-built binary is already provided in 
the binary package.

=== GENERAL INFORMATION =======================================================

This code implements a multiscale detector for visual object
recognition and notably for human detection. It requires three external
libraries:

-- Imlib2       for reading/writing images
-- Blitz        for efficient array processing
-- Boost        for many other general c++ utilities not present in ISO C++

Some portions of the code (notably the color conversion routines)
contain sources adapted from the Vigra Image Processing library
(http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~koethe/vigra/). Vigra is
templated image processing library distributed under the MIT X11
license. Where ever Vigra code has been used, this is mentioned in the
corresponding header file. A license file is included in the
distribution.

=== INSTALLATION ==============================================================

First install the development versions (*-devel RPM's or similar) of
the three external libraries as follows, making sure that the headers
and libraries are in your standard search paths :

Imlib2  - version 1.2.2 tested
Boost   - version 1.33.1 or later
Blitz   - version 0.9 tested (installed from source as no RPM's are
          currently available)

Then unpack the learcode.tar.gz file, change to it top level directory
and run ./configure. If the libraries were installed in nonstandard
places you can tell configure where to find them using, e.g.

  ./configure --with-blitz=/usr/local --with-boost=/usr/local ...
